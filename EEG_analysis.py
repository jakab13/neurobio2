# We further need the information of relative electrodes positions on the scalp to
# plot topographies and sensor positions on the scalp. The BrainVision company has
# their own file which contains the exact coordinates for their EEG setup, so we
# load that into the montage variable and set the montage into our Raw Object.

# From the raw data we are going to get the 'events' which are the time points
# at which a stimulus trigger was recorded.

events = mne.events_from_annotations(raw)[0]
mne.viz.plot_events(events)

# We will now cut the data into equally long segments around the stimuli to
# obtain the so-called epochs. For this we need to define some parameters:

tmin = -0.2
tmax = 0.5
reject_criteria = dict(eeg=200e-6)
flat_criteria = dict(eeg=1e-6)
event_id = {
    'tone_500': 1,
    'tone_2000': 2
}

                    reject_by_annotation=True, preload=True)

# We can now average over the epochs to obtain the ERP (= event-related potential).
# This is what we will work with in the next section.
# Select certain intervals in the joint plot and look at the topography. Does it look
# as expected? Where do we expect electric activity on the scalp to be highest for
# auditory evoked potentials?

epochs.average().plot_joint()

# We can plot the sensors ("topomap" or "3d") and decide on what electrodes we want
# to take as reference. We then select these as the reference or simply take an average
# of all electrodes activity as reference. You decide, which reference would in
# theory make most sense?

epochs.plot_sensors(kind="topomap", ch_type='all')
reference = ["TP10", "TP9"]

# After decision on which reference to choose, we can simply set and apply the
# reference.

epochs.set_eeg_reference(ref_channels=reference)

# Look at the ERP again: does the response look all right now, and how do you know?

epochs.average().plot_joint()

# However, this does not look right. There are big differences in the channels' baseline
# which overshadows the actual ERP. We can circumvent this by setting a channel-
# specific baseline. To do this we select a certain interval in the Epoch. For
# each channel, the mean of that interval will be subtracted from the rest of
# the epoch.
baseline = (-0.2, 0)
epochs.apply_baseline(baseline)
epochs.average().plot()
# The baseline can also be given as an argument when computing the epochs but
# we did not do this here for educational reasons.

# Now you can play with the parameters (start, stop and baseline) and see how
# the evoked response changes. For example: Try choosing an interval that
# contains more than one stimulus. Try using an interval with strong stimulus
# related activity as baseline.

# Assignment 1: plot the epoch average with different filter configurations,
# epoch intervals (tmin / tmax) and baseline intervals
